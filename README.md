A procedurally generated RPG developed using C#/Unity.

There are two main components to this project: a lore generator and an RPG game that runs in the world the lore generator produces.

The lore generator produces a world that an RPG game can run in. It generates the landscape of the world, the creatures in the world, the population of the world, and events that happen throughout history. Ideally, this generator will produce a very different world for the game each time it is played. The lore generator is currently under heavy development and will remain the primary focus for the near future.

Once the lore generator is in decent shape, work will begin on the RPG game itself. The game will pick up at the point in the timeline where the lore generator stopped and will allow the player to explore and interact with the created world. I envision it being a 2D, top-down game. To start out with, it will not have much point to it other than exploring the world, but I plan on eventually adding various quests to give some direction.
